# Alternative Datasets for AI Attitude Polarization Research

## 1. Pew Research Center — American Trends Panel (ATP) [BEST ALTERNATIVE]

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Waves with AI items** | Wave 119 (Dec 2022), Wave 152 (Aug 2024) |
| **Key question** | "More concerned than excited" vs "more excited than concerned" about AI |
| **Trend** | 38% concerned (2022) → 52% concerned (2024) |
| **Sample** | ~5,000–10,000 US adults per wave |
| **Panel design** | Same panel recruited via address-based sampling — potential for within-person longitudinal analysis if respondent IDs overlap across waves |
| **Data access** | **FREE download** at pewresearch.org/american-trends-panel-datasets/ |
| **Format** | SPSS (.sav), Stata (.dta) |
| **Demographics** | Age, gender, race, education, income, party ID, religion, region |
| **Strengths** | Nationally representative, free, well-documented, two time points for AI attitudes |
| **Limitations** | Only 2 waves with AI items (not truly longitudinal panel tracking), limited AI-specific variables compared to UAS |

**Why it works:** Two waves (2022, 2024) capture the critical ChatGPT inflection point. The concerned-vs-excited framing directly maps to our polarization framework. Party ID enables political polarization analysis.

## 2. Eurobarometer — Special Eurobarometer 554 (AI & Future of Work)

| **Topics** | AI attitudes, workplace AI, trust, regulation preferences |
| **Data access** | **FREE** via GESIS (gesis.org/en/eurobarometer-data-service) |
| **Format** | SPSS (.sav) |
| **Strengths** | Large N, cross-national comparison, free, well-documented |
| **Limitations** | EU-only (not US), cross-sectional (single wave), different cultural context |

## 3. Ipsos AI Monitor (Global Advisor)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Dates** | Annual since ~2021; 2024 wave available |
| **Sample** | ~20,000 adults across 32 countries |
| **Topics** | AI excitement, concern, trust, usage, impact expectations |
| **Data access** | **Tables/crosstabs available free**; full microdata requires Ipsos partnership or purchase |
| **Strengths** | Longitudinal (annual), global, tracks excitement & concern directly |
| **Limitations** | Microdata access unclear/costly, online panel (not probability-based in all countries) |

## 4. Gallup (US Daily / Social Series)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **AI items** | Added AI questions in recent waves |
| **Sample** | ~1,000+ US adults per wave |

| **Format** | SPSS, Stata |
| **Strengths** | High brand credibility, probability-based, rich demographics |
| **Limitations** | Not freely available, limited AI-specific content compared to dedicated AI surveys |

| **Date** | Aug–Nov 2024 (pre/post election) |
| **Sample** | ~5,000+ US adults |
| **Topics** | May include new AI items (15+ new topic areas added in 2024) |

## Recommendation

### Primary path: UAS (proceed with Data User Agreement)
The UAS remains the strongest dataset — 3 longitudinal waves (2023, 2024, 2025), rich AI-specific variables, nationally representative panel.

### Backup path: Pew ATP Wave 119 + Wave 152
If UAS access is delayed, Pew ATP is the best alternative:
- **Free and immediately downloadable**
- Two time points spanning the ChatGPT era (Dec 2022 → Aug 2024)
- Directly measures concerned-vs-excited framing
- Rich demographics including party ID
- Limitation: only 2 waves, fewer AI-specific items

### Complementary: Eurobarometer + Ipsos crosstabs
Can supplement as robustness checks or cross-cultural comparison in discussion section.
