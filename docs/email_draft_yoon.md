# Email Draft to Dr. Yoon

**To:** Dr. Yoon
**From:** Hosung You (hfy5138@psu.edu)
**Subject:** Request for Advisor Signature — UAS Data User Agreement

---

Dear Dr. Yoon,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request your signature on the attached UAS (Understanding America Study) Data User Agreement.

I am currently developing a research project examining **AI attitude polarization** using the Neely-UAS AI Index, a nationally representative longitudinal panel dataset maintained by USC Dornsife's Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR). The study aims to identify distinct trajectory classes of AI attitudes (excitement vs. concern) over time using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), and to examine demographic and psychological predictors of trajectory membership.

The UAS data portal requires that student users obtain an advisor's signature on the agreement (page 2) to gain access. I have already completed and signed my portion of the form (page 1).

**What the agreement requires from you:**
- Your name, title, phone number, and email
- A signature confirming that you will oversee my use of UAS data as part of a research project
- The signed form is then submitted to uas-l@maillist.usc.edu

I have attached the partially completed agreement for your review. If you have any questions or concerns about the data use conditions, I would be happy to discuss them at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
Hosung You
